# üöÄ Demo Vessel Segmentation Template

Thank you for hosting your algorithm on Grand-Challenge.org, we appreciate it!

## Content

This Algorithm Template contains a tailored example to help you run [your
algorithm on Grand-Challenge.org](https://grand-challenge.org/algorithms/miriam-test/).

It contains the following:
* Ô∏èü¶æ A set of example bash scripts (.sh) to _help_ you test your algorithm locally and export it as a container for upload.
* ü¶ø An example _python implementation_ that templates reading the inputs and writing the outputs.

See the header of the `interference.py` for more information.

Please note that this is supplementary to the [documentation](https://grand-challenge.org/documentation/algorithms/).
If the documentation does not answer your question, feel free to reach out to us at
[support@grand-challenge.org](mailto:support@grandchallenge.org).

The examples in this template illustrate one approach, but they are not the only option. Any container image will do as long as it:


- reads from the `/input/images/oct`

- reads from the `/input/age-in-months.json`


- outputs, correctly, to `/output/images/vessel-segmentation`
